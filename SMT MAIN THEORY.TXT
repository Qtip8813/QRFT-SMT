\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a novel framework where gravity emerges as a property of recursive quantum entanglement, challenging the traditional view of gravity as a fundamental force. We introduce a probabilistic model where entanglement density propagates recursively, forming event horizons as self-regulating limits. This approach posits entanglement as the universal governing law, with spacetime, gravity, mass-energy, and time as emergent phenomena. We present a mathematical formalism, enhanced by quantum error correction (QEC) and a Fractional-Bit AI to stabilize entanglement, and suggest experimental tests using LIGO, quantum optics, particle colliders, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This paradigm offers a potential unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity, redefining spacetime as a quantum-information network.

\section{Introduction}
The nature of gravity remains a central puzzle, with general relativity describing it as spacetime geometry and quantum mechanics lacking a direct mechanism. Recent advances in quantum information theory suggest that entanglement entropy may underpin spacetime structure \cite{ref:ryu-takayanagi}. This paper advances a recursive entanglement model, building on the Singularity Mechanics Theory (SMT), where gravity, spacetime, mass-energy, and time emerge as secondary effects of quantum correlations.

\section{Entanglement as the Universal Law}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fundamental Principle:} Entanglement is the primary force governing the universe, superseding traditional forces.
    \item \textbf{Gravity as Emergent:} Gravity arises from the clustering of entanglement, inducing spacetime curvature and mass distribution.
    \item \textbf{Spacetime as a Quantum Network:} Spacetime emerges from an interconnected web of entangled quantum states, not a pre-existing geometry.
    \item \textbf{Mass-Energy as Entanglement Density:} Mass emerges from the density of entangled states, aligning with an entanglement-information relationship.
    \item \textbf{Time as an Entanglement Propagation Process:} Timeâ€™s arrow results from the progressive spread of entanglement, driving entropy increase.
\end{itemize}

\section{Recursive Entanglement and Gravity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Entanglement Growth:} Entanglement propagates recursively, with clusters reinforcing each other, modeled as \( E_{n+1} = E_n \cdot \lambda + S_n \cdot \beta \), where \( S_n \) represents spin interactions.
    \item \textbf{Emergent Gravitational Effect:} Increasing entanglement density curves spacetime, manifesting as gravity, quantified by \( G_{\text{em}} = \alpha \sum_{n=0}^{N} E_n \).
    \item \textbf{Event Horizon as a Limiting Factor:} A critical entanglement threshold forms event horizons, limiting further entanglement and observation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Framework}
We define the recursive entanglement propagation as:
\begin{equation}
E_{n+1} = E_n \cdot \lambda + S_n \cdot \beta,
\label{eq:entanglement-propagation}
\end{equation}
where \( E_n \) is the entanglement density at step \( n \), \( \lambda \) is the growth factor, \( S_n \) represents spin-induced quantum correlations, and \( \beta \) is a correction factor.

The emergent gravitational strength is derived as:
\begin{equation}
G_{\text{em}} = \alpha \sum_{n=0}^{N} E_n,
\label{eq:gravitational-strength}
\end{equation}
where \( \alpha \) is a scaling factor linking entanglement to curvature.

The modified Einstein field equations, incorporating entanglement probability, are:
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \int P(E_n, S_n, f_r) T_{\mu\nu} \, d^3x,
\label{eq:modified-einstein}
\end{equation}
where \( G_{\mu\nu} \) is the Einstein tensor, \( \Lambda \) is the cosmological constant, \( P(E_n, S_n, f_r) \) is the entanglement probability function, \( f_r \) is the resonance frequency, and \( T_{\mu\nu} \) is the energy-momentum tensor.

Time emergence is modeled as:
\begin{equation}
\tau = \gamma \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{dE}{dt},
\label{eq:time-emergence}
\end{equation}
where \( \tau \) is the perceived time flow, and \( \gamma \) is a scaling coefficient.

\section{Quantum Error Correction and Stabilization}
To address decoherence, we employ a 7-qubit Steane code with Fractional-Bit AI enhancement:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stabilizer Generators:}
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    g_1 &= IIIXXXX, \\
    g_2 &= XIXIXIX, \\
    g_3 &= XXIIXXI, \\
    g_4 &= ZZZIIII, \\
    g_5 &= IZIZIZI, \\
    g_6 &= IIZIZIZ, \\
    g_7 &= ZZZZZZZ,
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    where \( g_7 \) monitors higher-dimensional entanglement, aligning with the fractional-bit entropy scaling in higher dimensions (see Section~\ref{sec:implications}).
    \item \textbf{Fractional-Bit Correction:} The AI applies weighted corrections \( C = a \cdot P \), where \( P \) is a Pauli operator (\( X \), \( Z \), or \( Y \)), and \( a \) (ranging from 1.0 to 2.0) adjusts based on syndrome measurements and error likelihood.
    \item \textbf{Stabilization Effect:} This stabilizes the quantum resonance \( \psi(t) \) post-QRFT activation, countering its natural decay, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stabilization}. The Fractional-Bit AI dynamically adjusts \( a \) to optimize entanglement preservation.
\end{itemize}

The red curve shows the original decay from 0.60 to 0.52 over 0.30 s, while the blue curve demonstrates stabilization at \( \psi \approx 0.58 \). Inset: Sharpened 3D FFT peak post-QEC, enhancing frequency coherence for LIGO analysis.}

\end{figure}

\section{Implications for Black Hole Physics}
\label{sec:implications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No Singularities:} Black hole cores are ultra-dense entanglement regions, limited by event horizons, with \( \lim_{E_n \to E_{max}} \nabla^2 \Psi = 0 \).
    \item \textbf{Quantum Information Conservation:} Hawking radiation is an entanglement transfer, preserved by QEC.
    \item \textbf{Spacetime as a Quantum Network:} Supports ER=EPR \cite{ref:er-epr}, with spacetime emerging from stabilized entanglement.
    \item \textbf{Cosmological Implications:} Dark matter and energy may reflect large-scale entanglement effects, potentially observable in CMB correlations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Validation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LIGO Data Analysis:} QEC-stabilized ringdown phases may reveal entanglement-driven deviations, as shown by the sharpened FFT peak in Figure~\ref{fig:stabilization}.
    \item \textbf{Quantum Optics Experiments:} Test entanglement saturation with 7-qubit codes in quantum networks, focusing on recursive entanglement limits.
    \item \textbf{High-Energy Particle Experiments:} Collider data may show mass fluctuations from stabilized entanglement, testing \( M = \int \Psi(E_n, f_r) dE_n \).
    \item \textbf{CMB Analysis:} Entanglement correlations in early-universe fluctuations may differ from classical inflation models, detectable in B-mode polarization.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes a paradigm shift where entanglement, stabilized by QEC and Fractional-Bit AI, is the universal law, with gravity, spacetime, and mass-energy as emergent effects. This framework, if validated, could unify quantum mechanics and general relativity, redefining spacetime as a quantum-information structure.
